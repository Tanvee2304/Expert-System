# Expert-System
An expert system is a form of artificial intelligence that emulates the decision-making abilities of a human expert. It uses a knowledge base (which contains factual and heuristic knowledge) and an inference engine to solve complex problems in a specific domain, offering recommendations, solutions, or decisions. Expert systems are widely used in domains like healthcare, finance, and education for providing tailored advice or suggestions.
The Job Interview Expert System is a rule-based AI system that leverages experta (a Python library for building expert systems) to offer personalized interview preparation. The system collects user inputs (such as job role and experience level) and uses a knowledge base of predefined rules to generate relevant interview questions. In this project, the experta library is used to build a rule-based system that outputs relevant interview questions and tips. The system uses forward chaining, where it starts with known facts (user inputs) and applies rules to reach conclusions (relevant interview questions).


The systemâ€™s main components include: 
1. Knowledge Base: Contains rules and facts about different job roles and experience levels. 
2. Inference Engine: Processes the rules and facts to deduce the relevant interview questions and tips. 
3. User Interface: A simple, user-friendly web interface developed using Flask, which allows users to interact with the system by selecting their job role and experience.
4.Experta: Experta is a Python library used to create rule-based expert systems. It is based on the CLIPS framework and provides a modern, Pythonic interface for defining rules, facts, and inference engines. It uses forward chaining to match facts with rules and derive conclusions. The rules are defined using simple if-then logic, allowing the system to simulate human expertise. 
5.Flask: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to develop the web interface for the expert system. Flask handles routing and rendering templates, allowing users to interact with the system by selecting their job role and experience level, and viewing the generated interview questions. 
6.HTML, CSS, JavaScript: HTML and CSS are used to structure and style the web pages for a clean, user-friendly interface. JavaScript is used to manage dynamic content.
